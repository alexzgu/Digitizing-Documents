img_1.jpg,"Order-of-growth classifications We use just a few structural primitives (state-
ments, conditionals, loops, nesting, and method calls) to implement algorithms, so very
often the order of growth of the cost is one of just a few functions of the problem size N.
These functions are summarized in the table on the facing page, along with the names
that we use to refer to them, typical code that leads to each function, and examples.
Constant. A program whose running time’s order of growth is constant executes a
fixed number of operations to finish its job; consequently its running time does not
depend on N. Most Java operations take constant time.
Logarithmic. A program whose running time’s order of growth is logarithmic is barely
slower than a constant-time program. The classic example of a program whose running
time is logarithmic in the problem size is binary search (see BinarySearch on page 47).
The base of the logarithm is not relevant with respect to the order of growth (since all
logarithms with a constant base are related by a constant factor), so we use log N when
referring to order of growth.
Linear. Programs that spend a constant amount of time processing each piece of input
data, or that are based on a single for loop, are quite common. The order of growth of
such a program is said to be linear —its running time is proportional to N.
Linearithmic. We use the term linearithmic to describe programs whose running time
for a problem of size N has order of growth N log N. Again, the base of the logarithm
is not relevant with respect to the order of growth. The prototypical examples of lin-
earithmic algorithms are Merge.sort() (see Algorithm 2.4) and Quick.sort() (see
Algorithm 2.5).
Quadratic. A typical program whose running time has order of growth N 2 has
two nested for loops, used for some calculation involving all pairs of N elements.
The elementary sorting algorithms Selection.sort() (see Algorithm 2.1) and
Insertion.sort() (see Algorithm 2.2) are prototypes of the programs in this
classification.
Cubic. A typical program whose running time has order of growth N 3 has three nested
for loops, used for some calculation involving all triples of N elements. Our example
for this section, ThreeSum, is a prototype.
Exponential. In CHAPTER 6 (but not until then!) we will consider programs whose
running times are proportional to 2N or higher. Generally, we use the term exponential
to refer to algorithms whose order of growth is b N for any constant b > 1, even though
different values of b lead to vastly different running times. Exponential algorithms are
extremely slow—you will never run one of them to completion for a large problem.
Still, exponential algorithms play a critical role in the theory of algorithms because"

img_3.jpg,"5.2 DIAGONALIZABILITY
 In Section 5.1, we presented the diagonalization problem and observed
 that not all linear operators or matrices are diagonalizable. Although we are
 able to diagonalize operator s and matrices and even obtain a necessary and
 sufficient condition for diagonalizability (Theorem 5.1 p. 247) , we have not
 yet solved the diagonaliza ti on problem. What is still needed is a simple test
 to determine whether an operator or a matrix can be diagonalized, as well
 as a method for actually finding a basis of eigenvectors. In this section , we
 develop such a test and method.
 In Example 6 of Section 5.1, we obtained a basis of eigenvectors by choos-
 ing one eigenvector corresponding to each eigenvalue. In general , such a procedure does not yield a
 basis, but the following theorem shows that any
 set constructed in this manner is linearly independent."
img_4.jpg,"Another important person in the history of probability is Abraham de Moivre,
 who was born in France in 1667, but, as a Protestant, he did not fare very well in
 that Catholic country. As a matter of fact, he was imprisoned for about two years
 for his beliefs. After his release, he went to England, but led a gloomy life there, as
 he could not find an academic position. So de Moivre supported himself by tutoring
 or consulting with gamblers or insurance brokers. After publishing The Doctrine of
 Chance, he turned to a project that Nicolaus Bernoulli had suggested to him. Using
 the fact that Y is b(n, p), he discovered that the relative frequency of successes,
 namely, Y/n, which Jacob Bernoulli had proved converged in probability to p, had
 an interesting approximating distribution itself. De Moivre had discovered the well-
 known bell-shaped curve called the normal distribution, and a special case of the
 central limit theorem. Although de Moivre did not have computers in his day, we
 show that if X is b(100, 1/2), then X/100 has the pmf displayed in Figure 5.9-3.
 This distribution allowed de Moivre to determine a measure of spread, which we
 now call a standard deviation. Also, he could determine the approximate probability
 of Y/n falling into given intervals containing p. De Moivre was truly impressed with
 the orderliness of these random relative frequencies, which he attributed to the plan
 of the Almighty. Despite his great works, Abraham de Moivre died a bitter and
 antisocial man, blind and in poverty, at the age of 87."
img_5.jpg,"Description: The aim of this course will be to familiarize you with a wide array of philosophical and
 religious traditions not only from the western world but also from eastern and indigenous traditions.
 Given that we cannot cover even a small portion of all of the important philosophical and religious
 developments of human history in seven weeks, the main aim of the course will be to introduce you to
 three different approaches humans have taken in their age-old search for truth and meaning.

First, we will look to religions and philosophical traditions which look to the beyond, to something which
 transcends our immediate experience of life, in order to make sense of life and the universe. Second, we
 will study traditions that look to the here and now for an answer to these questions; who see the meaning
 of life as immanent within our own experience if we are willing to look deeply enough. Finally, we will
 study those traditions that see an understanding of relationality as essential to understanding ourselves
 and the world; who believe that is through our relationships with others, the earth, and our communities
 in which we can find the deepest truths of what life has to offer.

Our goal will be to learn to relate to these various points of view on life, the human, and the universe in
 two ways. First, I simply want us to learn how to understand and appreciate the different positions these
 thinkers and traditions provide. Appreciating and seeing the rationale within these different perspectives
 will help us to understand that the way we have been conditioned to understand the world is not
 necessarily the way the world is. We will see that there are other points of view on the world that are just
 as, and maybe even more, reasonable than our own. Second, beyond merely understanding these
 different philosophical perspectives, we will use them as tools to learn how to do philosophy ourselves. All
 of us have assumptions or beliefs concerning some, if not all, of these topics. When doing philosophy we
 want to understand what our own assumptions are and make use of these different philosophical
 perspectives to critically evaluate these beliefs and assumptions. This is one of the main aims of
 philosophy and of studying religion in a philosophical manner, to become aware of and evaluate our own
 assumptions."

img_7.jpg,"In recent years, the standard undergraduate curriculum in mathematics has
been subjected to steady pressure from several different sources. As computers
and technology become more ubiquitous, so do the areas where mathematical
thinking can be a valuable asset. Rather than preparing themselves for graduate
study in pure mathematics, the present majority of mathematics majors look
forward to careers in banking, medicine, law, and numerous other fields where
analytical skills are desirable. Another strong influence on college mathemat-
ics is the ongoing calculus reform effort, now well over ten years old. At the
core of this movement is the justifiable goal of presenting calculus in a more
intuitive way, emphasizing geometric arguments over symbolic ones. Despite
these various trends—or perhaps because of them—nearly every undergraduate
mathematics program continues to require at least one semester of real analysis.
The result is that instructors today are faced with the task of teaching a diffi-
cult, abstract course to a more diverse audience less familiar with the nature of
axiomatic arguments."
img_8.jpg,"It is helpful to have an overall outline of the topics to be included in a proposal before you
begin writing. Thus this chapter begins with different outlines for writing proposals; they can be
used as models depending on whether your proposed study is qualitative, quantitative, or
mixed methods. Then I convey several ideas about the actual writing of the proposal, such as
developing a habit of writing, and grammar ideas that have been helpful to me in improving my
scholarly writing. Finally, I turn to ethical issues and discuss these not as abstract ideas, but as
considerations that need to be anticipated in all phases of the research process."
img_9.jpg,"How would this working title be written? Try completing this sentence, “My study is about. . . .”
A response might be, “My study is about at-risk children in the junior high,” or “My study is
about helping college faculty become better researchers.” At this stage in the design, frame the
answer to the question so that another scholar might easily grasp the meaning of the project. A
common shortcoming of beginning researchers is that they frame their study in complex and
erudite language. This perspective may result from reading published articles that have
undergone numerous revisions before being set in print. Good, sound research projects begin
with straightforward, uncomplicated thoughts, easy to read and to understand. Think about a
journal article that you have read recently. If it was easy and quick to read, it was likely written
in general language that many readers could easily identify with, in a way that was
straightforward and simple in overall design and conceptualization."
img_10.jpg,"The system of linear equations in the preceding example was easy to
solve because the matrix in (2.38) has this particularly convenient form,
which allowed us to find the particular and the general solution by in-
spection. However, general equation systems are not of this simple form.
Fortunately, there exists a constructive algorithmic way of transforming
any system of linear equations into this particularly simple form: Gaussian
elimination. Key to Gaussian elimination are elementary transformations
of systems of linear equations, which transform the equation system into
a simple form. Then, we can apply the three steps to the simple form that
we just discussed in the context of the example in (2.38)."

img_13.jpg,"Course Description
Logic generally is the study of correct reasoning. More specifically, it studies valid arguments. Symbolic logic bypasses natural lan-
guage arguments and treats the formalizations of these arguments as objects of study in their own right. Throughout this course, 
we'll closely study three logics and their extensions:
• Propositional logic: This logic formalizes declarative sentences (like ""It's raining in South 
Hadley"" and ""if it's raining in South Hadley, then we'll all get wet""), and and treats them and their connections as the atomic elements of study.
—It introduces the idea of a sentential connective, truth-conditional semantics (a formal way of saying whether sentences 
in our formal language are true or false), and well-formed formulas. We'll study these, along with proof systems and some 
meta-logical concepts such as soundness and completeness. We'll also study some extensions of classical propositional 
logic (where there are only two truth-values for formulas, ""true"" and ""false"") where sentences can take a truth-value that 
is neither just true nor just false.
• Predicate logic: This logic splits the atom of the declarative sentence to reveal more internal structure.
—It adds the expressive resource of quantifiers, expressed in natural languages by words like ""all,"" ""aucun,"" or ""sapa."" It 
also adds the expressive resource of predicates such as ""is green"" or ""is a word in Quechua."" We'll study these new logical 
concepts and extend the semantics we developed for propositional logic to this new formal language. We'll look at meta- 
logical concepts such as soundness and completeness for the resulting logic, as well as proof systems for this new logic. 
We'll also study some extensions of classical predicate logic, such as predicate logic with identity and free logic.
• Propositional modal logic: This logic extends classical propositional logic to study formalizations of natural language concepts 
like possibility and necessity.
—It adds the expressive resource of so-called modal operators, which express modal concepts such as possibility and ne-
cessity. We'll study the grammar of this new logic and its semantics, so-called ""possible world"" semantics. We'll study 
axiomatic proof systems for this logic, as well as meta-logical results such as soundness and completeness. We'll also explore 
applications or variants of propositional modal logic, such as deontic logic, epistemic logic, and tense logic."

Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:, failure to attribute something to a source and passing off someone else's (a classmate's, 
a Chegg tutor's, etc) work as your own. If, being the scrupulous sort, you are in doubt whether a particular part of a paper is potentially

in any direction. Many mobile bases, however, such as cars and differential-
drive robots, use more typical wheels, which do not slip sideways. These no-slip
constraints are fundamentally different from the loop-closure constraints found
in closed chains; the latter are holonomic, meaning that they are configuration
constraints, while the former are nonholonomic, meaning that the velocity
constraints cannot be integrated to become equivalent configuration constraints.
Because of the different properties of omnidirectional mobile robots ver-
sus nonholonomic mobile robots, we consider their kinematic modeling, motion
planning, and control separately. In particular, the motion planning and con-
trol of nonholonomic mobile robots is more challenging than for omnidirectional
mobile robots.
Once we have derived their kinematic models, we show that the odometry
problem – the estimation of the chassis configuration based on wheel encoder
data – can be solved in the same way for both types of mobile robots. Similarly,
for mobile manipulators consisting of a wheeled base and a robot arm, we show
that feedback control for mobile manipulation (controlling the motion of the
end-effector using the arm joints and wheels) is the same for both types of
mobile robots. The fundamental object in mobile manipulation is the Jacobian
mapping joint rates and wheel velocities to end-effector twists.

As an academic discipline, robotics is a relatively young field with highly am- 
bitious goals, the ultimate one being the creation of machines that can behave 
and think like humans. This attempt to create intelligent machines naturally 
leads us first to examine ourselves – to ask, for example, why our bodies are 
designed the way they are, how our limbs are coordinated, and how we learn and 
perform complex tasks. The sense that the fundamental questions in robotics 
are ultimately questions about ourselves is part of what makes robotics such a 
fascinating and engaging endeavor.
Our focus in this book is on mechanics, planning, and control for robot 
mechanisms. Robot arms are one familiar example. So are wheeled vehicles, 
as are robot arms mounted on wheeled vehicles. Basically, a mechanism is con
structed by connecting rigid bodies, called links, together by means of joints, 
so that relative motion between adjacent links becomes possible. Actuation of 
the joints, typically by electric motors, then causes the robot to move and exert 
forces in desired ways.
The links of a robot mechanism can be arranged in serial fashion, like the 
familiar open-chain arm shown in Figure 1.1(a). Robot mechanisms can also 
have links that form closed loops, such as the Stewart–Gough platform shown 
in Figure 1.1(b). In the case of an open chain, all the joints are actuated, while 
in the case of mechanisms with closed loops, only a subset of the joints may be 
actuated.
Let us examine more closely the current technology behind robot mecha-
nisms. The links are moved by actuators, which typically are electrically driven 
(e.g., by DC or AC motors, stepper motors, or shape memory alloys) but can 
also be driven by pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders. In the case of rotating"
img_32.jpg,"electric motors, these would ideally be lightweight, operate at relatively low ro
tational speeds (e.g., in the range of hundreds of RPM), and be able to generate 
large forces and torques. Since most currently available motors operate at low 
torques and at up to thousands of RPM, speed reduction and torque ampli
fication are required. Examples of such transmissions or transformers include 
gears, cable drives, belts and pulleys, and chains and sprockets. These speed
reduction devices should have zero or low slippage and backlash (defined as 
the amount of rotation available at the output of the speed-reduction device 
without motion at the input). Brakes may also be attached to stop the robot 
quickly or to maintain a stationary posture.
Robots are also equipped with sensors to measure the motion at the joints. 
For both revolute and prismatic joints, encoders, potentiometers, or resolvers 
measure the displacement and sometimes tachometers are used to measure ve
locity. Forces and torques at the joints or at the end-effector of the robot can be 
measured using various types of force–torque sensors. Additional sensors may 
be used to help localize objects or the robot itself, such as vision-only cameras, 
RGB-D cameras which measure the color (RGB) and depth (D) to each pixel, 
laser range finders, and various types of acoustic sensor.
The study of robotics often includes artificial intelligence and computer per-
ception, but an essential feature of any robot is that it moves in the physical"
img_33.jpg,"world. Therefore, this book, which is intended to support a first course in 
robotics for undergraduates and graduate students, focuses on mechanics, mo
tion planning, and control of robot mechanisms.
In the rest of this chapter we provide a preview of the rest of the book.
Chapter 2: Configuration Space
As mentioned above, at its most basic level a robot consists of rigid bodies 
connected by joints, with the joints driven by actuators. In practice the links 
may not be completely rigid, and the joints may be affected by factors such as 
elasticity, backlash, friction, and hysteresis. In this book we ignore these effects 
for the most part and assume that all links are rigid.
With this assumption, Chapter 2 focuses on representing the configuration 
of a robot system, which is a specification of the position of every point of the 
robot. Since the robot consists of a collection of rigid bodies connected by 
joints, our study begins with understanding the configuration of a rigid body. 
We see that the configuration of a rigid body in the plane can be described 
using three variables (two for the position and one for the orientation) and the 
configuration of a rigid body in space can be described using six variables (three 
for the position and three for the orientation). The number of variables is the 
number of degrees of freedom (dof) of the rigid body. It is also the dimension 
of the configuration space, the space of all configurations of the body.
The dof of a robot, and hence the dimension of its configuration space, is 
the sum of the dof of its rigid bodies minus the number of constraints on the 
motion of those rigid bodies provided by the joints. For example, the two most 
popular joints, revolute (rotational) and prismatic (translational) joints, allow 
only one motion freedom between the two bodies they connect. Therefore a 
revolute or prismatic joint can be thought of as providing five constraints on 
the motion of one spatial rigid body relative to another. Knowing the dof of 
a rigid body and the number of constraints provided by joints, we can derive 
Grubler’s formula for calculating the dof of general robot mechanisms. For 
open-chain robots such as the industrial manipulator of Figure 1.1(a), each 
joint is independently actuated and the dof is simply the sum of the freedoms 
provided by each joint. For closed chains like the Stewart–Gough platform in 
Figure 1.1(b), Grubler’s formula is a convenient way to calculate the dof. 
Unlike open-chain robots, some joints of closed chains are not actuated.
Apart from calculating the dof, other configuration space concepts of interest 
include the topology (or “shape”) of the configuration space and its repre-
sentation. Two configuration spaces of the same dimension may have different 
shapes, just like a two-dimensional plane has a different shape from the two-"
img_34.jpg,"dimensional surface of a sphere. These differences become important when de-
termining how to represent the space. The surface of a unit sphere, for example, 
could be represented using a minimal number of coordinates, such as latitude 
and longitude, or it could be represented by three numbers (x, y, z) subject to 
the constraint x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1. The former is an explicit parametrization 
of the space and the latter is an implicit parametrization of the space. Each 
type of representation has its advantages, but in this book we will use implicit 
representations of configurations of rigid bodies.
A robot arm is typically equipped with a hand or gripper, more generally 
called an end-effector, which interacts with objects in the surrounding world. 
To accomplish a task such as picking up an object, we are concerned with the 
configuration of a reference frame rigidly attached to the end-effector, and not 
necessarily the configuration of the entire arm. We call the space of positions 
and orientations of the end-effector frame the task space and note that there 
is not a one-to-one mapping between the robot’s configuration space and the 
task space. The workspace is defined to be the subset of the task space that 
the end-effector frame can reach.
Chapter 3: Rigid-Body Motions
This chapter addresses the problem of how to describe mathematically the mo-
tion of a rigid body moving in three-dimensional physical space. One convenient 
way is to attach a reference frame to the rigid body and to develop a way to 
quantitatively describe the frame’s position and orientation as it moves. As a 
first step, we introduce a 3 × 3 matrix representation for describing a frame’s 
orientation; such a matrix is referred to as a rotation matrix.
A rotation matrix is parametrized by three independent coordinates. The 
most natural and intuitive way to visualize a rotation matrix is in terms of its 
exponential coordinate representation. That is, given a rotation matrix R, 
there exists some unit vector ˆω ∈ R 3 and angle θ ∈ [0, π] such that the rota-
tion matrix can be obtained by rotating the identity frame (that is, the frame 
corresponding to the identity matrix) about ˆω by θ. The exponential coordi-
nates are defined as ω = ˆωθ ∈ R 3 , which is a three-parameter representation. 
There are several other well-known coordinate representations, e.g., Euler an
gles, Cayley–Rodrigues parameters, and unit quaternions, which are discussed 
in Appendix B.
Another reason for focusing on the exponential description of rotations is 
that they lead directly to the exponential description of rigid-body motions. 
The latter can be viewed as a modern geometric interpretation of classical screw 
theory. Keeping the classical terminology as much as possible, we cover in detail"
img_35.jpg,"the linear algebraic constructs of screw theory, including the unified description 
of linear and angular velocities as six-dimensional twists (also known as spa-
tial velocities), and an analogous description of three-dimensional forces and 
moments as six-dimensional wrenches (also known as spatial forces).
Chapter 4: Forward Kinematics
For an open chain, the position and orientation of the end-effector are uniquely 
determined from the joint positions. The forward kinematics problem is to 
find the position and orientation of the reference frame attached to the end-
effector given the set of joint positions. In this chapter we present the product 
of exponentials (PoE) formula describing the forward kinematics of open 
chains. As the name implies, the PoE formula is directly derived from the expo-
nential coordinate representation for rigid-body motions. Aside from providing 
an intuitive and easily visualizable interpretation of the exponential coordinates 
as the twists of the joint axes, the PoE formula offers other advantages, like 
eliminating the need for link frames (only the base frame and end-effector frame 
are required, and these can be chosen arbitrarily).
In Appendix C we also present the Denavit–Hartenberg (D–H) representa-
tion for forward kinematics. The D–H representation uses fewer parameters but 
requires that reference frames be attached to each link following special rules of 
assignment, which can be cumbersome. Details of the transformation from the 
D–H to the PoE representation are also provided in Appendix C.
Chapter 5: Velocity Kinematics and Statics
Velocity kinematics refers to the relationship between the joint linear and an-
gular velocities and those of the end-effector frame. Central to velocity kine-
matics is the Jacobian of the forward kinematics. By multiplying the vector 
of joint-velocity rates by this configuration-dependent matrix, the twist of the 
end-effector frame can be obtained for any given robot configuration. Kine-
matic singularities, which are configurations in which the end-effector frame 
loses the ability to move or rotate in one or more directions, correspond to those 
configurations at which the Jacobian matrix fails to have maximal rank. The 
manipulability ellipsoid, whose shape indicates the ease with which the robot 
can move in various directions, is also derived from the Jacobian.
Finally, the Jacobian is also central to static force analysis. In static equilib-
rium settings, the Jacobian is used to determine what forces and torques need to 
be exerted at the joints in order for the end-effector to apply a desired wrench."
img_36.jpg,"The definition of the Jacobian depends on the representation of the end-
effector velocity, and our preferred representation of the end-effector velocity
is as a six-dimensional twist. We touch briefly on other representations of the
end-effector velocity and their corresponding Jacobians.
Chapter 6: Inverse Kinematics
The inverse kinematics problem is to determine the set of joint positions
that achieves a desired end-effector configuration. For open-chain robots, the
inverse kinematics is in general more involved than the forward kinematics: for
a given set of joint positions there usually exists a unique end-effector position
and orientation but, for a particular end-effector position and orientation, there
may exist multiple solutions to the joint positions, or no solution at all.
In this chapter we first examine a popular class of six-dof open-chain struc-
tures whose inverse kinematics admits a closed-form analytic solution. Itera-
tive numerical algorithms are then derived for solving the inverse kinematics
of general open chains by taking advantage of the inverse of the Jacobian. If
the open-chain robot is kinematically redundant, meaning that it has more
joints than the dimension of the task space, then we use the pseudoinverse of
the Jacobian.
Chapter 7: Kinematics of Closed Chains
While open chains have unique forward kinematics solutions, closed chains of-
ten have multiple forward kinematics solutions, and sometimes even multiple
solutions for the inverse kinematics as well. Also, because closed chains possess
both actuated and passive joints, the kinematic singularity analysis of closed
chains presents subtleties not encountered in open chains. In this chapter we
study the basic concepts and tools for the kinematic analysis of closed chains.
We begin with a detailed case study of mechanisms such as the planar five-bar
linkage and the Stewart–Gough platform. These results are then generalized
into a systematic methodology for the kinematic analysis of more general closed
chains.
Chapter 8: Dynamics of Open Chains
Dynamics is the study of motion taking into account the forces and torques
that cause it. In this chapter we study the dynamics of open-chain robots. In
analogy to the notions of a robot’s forward and inverse kinematics, the forward
dynamics problem is to determine the resulting joint accelerations for a given
set of joint forces and torques. The inverse dynamics problem is to determine"
img_37.jpg,"the input joint torques and forces needed for desired joint accelerations. The
dynamic equations relating the forces and torques to the motion of the robot’s
links are given by a set of second-order ordinary differential equations.
The dynamics for an open-chain robot can be derived using one of two ap-
proaches. In the Lagrangian approach, first a set of coordinates – referred to
as generalized coordinates in the classical dynamics literature – is chosen to
parametrize the configuration space. The sum of the potential and kinetic
energies of the robot’s links are then expressed in terms of the generalized
coordinates and their time derivatives. These are then substituted into the
Euler–Lagrange equations, which then lead to a set of second-order differ-
ential equations for the dynamics, expressed in the chosen coordinates for the
configuration space.
The Newton–Euler approach builds on the generalization of f = ma, i.e.,
the equations governing the acceleration of a rigid body given the wrench acting
on it. Given the joint variables and their time derivatives, the Newton–Euler
approach to inverse dynamics is: to propagate the link velocities and accelera-
tions outward from the proximal link to the distal link, in order to determine
the velocity and acceleration of each link; to use the equations of motion for
a rigid body to calculate the wrench (and therefore the joint force or torque)
that must be acting on the outermost link; and to proceed along the links back
toward the base of the robot, calculating the joint forces or torques needed to
create the motion of each link and to support the wrench transmitted to the dis-
tal links. Because of the open-chain structure, the dynamics can be formulated
recursively.
In this chapter we examine both approaches to deriving a robot’s dynamic
equations. Recursive algorithms for both the forward and inverse dynamics, as
well as analytical formulations of the dynamic equations, are presented.
Chapter 9: Trajectory Generation
What sets a robot apart from an automated machine is that it should be easily
reprogrammable for different tasks. Different tasks require different motions,
and it would be unreasonable to expect the user to specify the entire time-
history of each joint for every task; clearly it would be desirable for the robot’s
control computer to “fill in the details” from a small set of task input data.
This chapter is concerned with the automatic generation of joint trajectories
from this set of task input data. Formally, a trajectory consists of a path, which
is a purely geometric description of the sequence of configurations achieved by
a robot, and a time scaling, which specifies the times at which those configu-
rations are reached."
img_38.jpg,"Often the input task data is given in the form of an ordered set of joint values,
called control points, together with a corresponding set of control times. On the
basis of this data the trajectory generation algorithm produces a trajectory for
each joint which satisfies various user-supplied conditions. In this chapter we
focus on three cases: (i) point-to-point straight-line trajectories in both joint
space and task space; (ii) smooth trajectories passing through a sequence of
timed “via points”; and (iii) time-optimal trajectories along specified paths, 
subject to the robot’s dynamics and actuator limits. Finding paths that avoid
collisions is the subject of the next chapter on motion planning.
Chapter 10: Motion Planning
This chapter addresses the problem of finding a collision-free motion for a robot
through a cluttered workspace, while avoiding joint limits, actuator limits, and
other physical constraints imposed on the robot. The path planning problem
is a subproblem of the general motion planning problem that is concerned with
finding a collision-free path between a start and goal configuration, usually
without regard to the dynamics, the duration of the motion, or other constraints
on the motion or control inputs.
There is no single planner applicable to all motion planning problems. In
this chapter we consider three basic approaches: grid-based methods, sampling
methods, and methods based on virtual potential fields.
Chapter 11: Robot Control
A robot arm can exhibit a number of different behaviors depending on the task
and its environment. It can act as a source of programmed motions for tasks
such as moving an object from one place to another, or tracing a trajectory for
manufacturing applications. It can act as a source of forces, for example when
grinding or polishing a workpiece. In tasks such as writing on a chalkboard, it
must control forces in some directions (the force pressing the chalk against the
board) and motions in other directions (the motion in the plane of the board).
In certain applications, e.g., haptic displays, we may want the robot to act like
a programmable spring, damper, or mass, by controlling its position, velocity,
or acceleration in response to forces applied to it.
In each of these cases, it is the job of the robot controller to convert the
task specification to forces and torques at the actuators. Control strategies to
achieve the behaviors described above are known as motion (or position) con-
trol, force control, hybrid motion–force control, and impedance con-
trol. Which of these behaviors is appropriate depends on both the task and"
img_39.jpg,"the environment. For example, a force-control goal makes sense when the end-
effector is in contact with something, but not when it is moving in free space.
We also have a fundamental constraint imposed by the mechanics, irrespective
of the environment: the robot cannot independently control both motions and
forces in the same direction. If the robot imposes a motion then the environment
determines the force, and vice versa.
Most robots are driven by actuators that apply a force or torque to each
joint. Hence, precisely controlling a robot requires an understanding of the
relationship between the joint forces and torques and the motion of the robot;
this is the domain of dynamics. Even for simple robots, however, the dynamic
equations are complex and dependent on a precise knowledge of the mass and
inertia of each link, which may not be readily available. Even if it were, the
dynamic equations would still not reflect physical phenomena such as friction,
elasticity, backlash, and hysteresis.
Most practical control schemes compensate for these uncertainties by using
feedback control. After examining the performance limits of feedback control
without a dynamic model of the robot, we study motion control algorithms,
such as computed torque control, that combine approximate dynamic mod-
eling with feedback control. The basic lessons learned for robot motion control
are then applied to force control, hybrid motion–force control, and impedance
control.
Chapter 12: Grasping and Manipulation
The focus of earlier chapters is on characterizing, planning, and controlling the
motion of the robot itself. To do useful work, the robot must be capable of
manipulating objects in its environment. In this chapter we model the con-
tact between the robot and an object, specifically the constraints on the object
motion imposed by a contact and the forces that can be transmitted through a
frictional contact. With these models we study the problem of choosing contacts
to immobilize an object by form closure and force closure grasping. We also
apply contact modeling to manipulation problems other than grasping, such as
pushing an object, carrying an object dynamically, and testing the stability of
a structure.
Chapter 13: Wheeled Mobile Robots
The final chapter addresses the kinematics, motion planning, and control of
wheeled mobile robots and of wheeled mobile robots equipped with robot arms.
A mobile robot can use specially designed omniwheels or mecanum wheels"

objects from their being perceived, so as to conceive them existing un-
perceived? Light and colours, heat and cold, extension and figures, in a
word the things we see and feel, what are they but so many sensations,
notions, ideas or impressions on the sense; and is it possible to separate,
even in thought, any of these from perception? For my part I might as
easily divide a thing from itself. I may indeed divide in my thoughts or
conceive apart from each other these things which, perhaps, I never
perceived by sense so divided. Thus I imagine the trunk of a human body
without the limbs, or conceive the smell of rose without thinking on the
rose itself. So far I will not deny I can abstract, if that may properly be
called abstraction, which extends only to the conceiving separately such
objects, as it is possible may really exist or be actually perceived asunder.
But my conceiving or imagining power does not extend beyond the
possibility of real existence or perception. Hence as it is impossible for me
to see or feel anything without an actual sensation of that thing, so is it
impossible for me to conceive in my thoughts any sensible thing or object
distinct from the sensation or perception of it.
6. Some truths there are so near and obvious to the mind, that a man
need only open his eyes to see them. Such I take this important one to be, to
wit, that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth, in a word all
those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world, have not any
subsistence without a mind, that their being is to be perceived or known;
that consequently so long as they are not actually perceived by me, or do
not exist in my mind or that of any other created spirit, they must either
have no existence at all, or else subsist in the mind of some eternal spir-
it: it being perfectly unintelligible and involving all the absurdity of
abstraction, to attribute to any single part of them an existence indepen-
dent of a spirit. To be convinced of which, the reader need only reflect and
try to separate in his own thoughts the being of a sensible thing from its
being perceived.
7. From what has been said, it follows, there is not any other substance
than spirit, or that which perceives. But for the fuller proof of this point, let
it be considered, the sensible qualities are colour, figure, motion, smell,
taste, and such like, that is, the ideas perceived by sense. Now for an idea to
exist in an unperceiving thing, is a manifest contradiction; for to have an
idea is all one as to perceive: that therefore wherein colour, figure, and the"
